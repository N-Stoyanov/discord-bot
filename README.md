# Discord Bot

This is my discord bot project. It includes commands like !hello, !shutdown, and reaction handling.
This project will be used to learn python and enhance my technical skills.

It will also help me with a future project, which is a discord bot that displays the items that Destiny 2 vendors have.

UPDATE: This project is being delayed due to wanting to pursue data analysis/science projects.
